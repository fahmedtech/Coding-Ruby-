<h2>IT 211 -- Project 2<br>
Write Pseudocode and Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h2>

<h3>Part A (50 points): Write Pseudocode for an Algorithm that Occurs in Everyday Life</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Write pseudocode for an algorithm that occurs in everyday life.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your pseudocode should have at least one if statement and at least one
while loop.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Look at the Baking Bread, Washing Clothes, and Sorting Mail algorithms in
the <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/structured.htm">Structured Programming Details</a> document.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some examples of algorithms that occur in everyday life:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Deciding which golf club to choose when hitting a ball.</li>
<li>Deciding what to buy at the grocery store.</li>
<li>Detailed steps for calling a friend. (Include what happens when line is busy or there is no answer.)</li>
<li>Deciding which clothes to wear when getting dressed in the morning.</li>
<li>Deciding who to ask out on a date.</li>
</ol><br></li>
<li>Grading breakdown: Correctness: 75%; Originality/Creativity: 15%; Indentation: 10%.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part B (100 points): Implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h3>
</a><ul type="disc"><a name="2b">

<li>Write a Ruby script that allows a human player to play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.   
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>To play the game, the human player chooses one of "rock," "paper," or 
"scissors."  The computer also chooses, randomly with equal probability, one of these three plays.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>These phases determine the winner for each combination: "rock crushes scissors", "scissors cuts paper," and "paper covers rock."
<br>&nbsp;</li>

</a><li><a name="2b">In </a><a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/projects/rock-paper-scissors.png">this diagram</a>, each arrow points from the winner to the user.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>If both the human and the computer choose the same play, there is a tie.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Here is a sample script output.  The human player's choices are shown in red.<br>
<ul>
<pre>Enter human play (rock, paper, scissors): <span style="color:red">paper</span>
Computer plays rock.
Paper covers rock.
Human wins.
Score: Human 1, Computer 0.

Enter human play (rock, paper, scissors): <span style="color:red">scissors</span>
Computer plays scissors.
Tie.
Score: Human 1.5, Computer 0.5.

Enter human play (rock, paper, scissors): <span style="color:red">scissors</span>
Computer plays rock.
Rock crushes scissors.
Computer wins.
Score: Human 1.5, Computer 1.5.
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>You can base your script on this pseudocode:<br>
<ul>
<pre>set human score to 0.0
set computer score to 0.0

while true

  input human play with prompt
  choose random number from 0, 1, or 2
  
  if random number is 0
    set computer play to rock
  elsif random number is 1
    set computer play to paper
  elseif random number is 2
    set computer play to scissors
  end
  
  if human plays rock and computer plays rock
    Result is tie.
    Add 0.5 to each score.
  elsif human plays rock and computer plays paper
    Result is computer wins.
    Add 1 to computer score.
  elsif human plays rock and computer plays scissors
    Result is human wins.
    Add 1 to human score.
  elsif human plays paper and computer plays rock
    Result is human wins.
    Add 1 to human score.
  elsif human plays paper and computer plays paper
    Result is tie.
    Add 0.5 to each score.
  elsif human plays paper and computer plays scissors
    Result is computer wins.
    Add 1 to computer score.
  elsif human plays scissors and computer plays rock
    Result is computer wins.
    Add 1 to computer score.
  elsif human plays scissors and computer plays paper
    Result is human wins.
    Add 1 to human score.
  elsif human plays scissors and computer plays scissors
    Result is tie.
    Add 0.5 to each score.
  end
  display human score and computer score

end
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>Use Control-C to interrupt and terminate your script when you are finished 
playing the game.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>If you hope to receive an A in the class, you should implement this enhanced 
game called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. The rules of this enhanced game 
are shown in
<a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/projects/enhanced-rock-paper-scissors.png">this diagram</a>.  Whereas the original game has 9 (3 × 3) possible move combinations, the enhanced game has 25 (5 × 5) move combinations.

<li><strong>Grading breakdown:</strong> Functionality: 60%, User interface, including spelling and grammar: 10%, Comments: 10%, Indentation: 10%, Submitted properly: 10%</li>
